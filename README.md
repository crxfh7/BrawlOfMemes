Hello to everyone who is reading this, I hope you have a great day!

I started a game project out of boredom and now I am working on it if I have some free time.

THE IDEA:
The Idea of the game is to collect cards.
All cards are unique and the theme of the game will be memes (Gigachad, Noot Noot, etc.)
The Cards will have stats for fighting, so you can actually do something beside collecting your favorite meme.

FILES:
The current files I have uploaded are just some basic functions for the beginning, you can't do much with the files at the moment

I have nothing more to say at the moment, but if you are interested in the game or have questions, feel free to ask me!
